# upvm
Leverage virt-builder &amp; virt-install to spin up new VMs with ease

### Requirements

You need:

- libvirtd & libvirt-client (`virsh`)
- libguestfs-tools (`virt-builder`)
- virt-install

These two are not required, but are highly recommended for bash-tab-completion & config-file support:
 
- `pip install argcomplete; activate-global-python-argcomplete`
- `pip install configargparse`

### Install

You can clone the git repo and execute `upvm.py` from it. For rpm installation in RHEL 7.2+ and Fedora 22+:

1. `dnf install http://people.redhat.com/rsawhill/rpms/latest-rsawaroha-release.rpm`
1. `dnf install upvm`
1. `/usr/share/upvm/initial-setup`
1. `upvm -h`

Leverage virt-builder & virt-install to spin up new VMs with ease

SIMPLE OPTIONS:
  Tweak runtime behavior of upvm.

  --loglevel {debug,info,error}
                        Control verbosity during operation; with 'debug', all
                        external command-calls are logged, including full
                        virt-builder & virt-install cmdlines; with 'info',
                        tidbits of status messages are printing along the way
  --build-image-only    Quit after virt-builder finishes making the image file
  --nocolor             Disable all color terminal enhancements
  --noconsole           Disable post-install auto-execution of 'sudo virsh
                        console VMNAME' (automatically disabled when running
                        with no tty)
  --cachedir VBCACHEDIR
                        Set the directory for virt-builder cached templates
                        (default: '/var/cache/upvm' which is only writable by
                        members of the 'libvirt' group; note that this
                        contrasts with virt-builder's default more secure &
                        more wasteful behavior of saving per-user cache in
                        homedirs)
  -h                    Show short usage summary and exit
  --help                Show this help message and exit

SELECTING INITIAL IMAGE TO BUILD:
  Choose template to build with virt-builder.

  TEMPLATE              Specify the template to install from
  -l, --list            List available templates
  --arch {x86_64,i386,i686,ia64,armv71,ppc,ppc64,ppc64le,aarch64,sparc64,s390,s390x}
                        Specify architecture in case there are multiple
                        choices (defaults to same architecture as upvm)
  --info                Print virt-builder metadata for chosen template

IMPORTANT HARDWARE-LEVEL (VM) OPTIONS:
  Guest hardware configured by virt-install (after image is built).

  -n, --name VMNAME     Guest name will be VMNAME (defaults to value of
                        TEMPLATE)
  --os-variant OS       Optionally override auto-detected os-type to disable
                        virt-io (default is 'auto', unlike virt-install
                        itself; see virt-install --os-variant)

TOTALLY OPTIONAL OS-LEVEL OPTIONS:
  Disk image modifications done by virt-builder.

  --root-password SELECTOR
                        If this option is not used (either on cmdline or via
                        config file), upvm will prompt for the root password
                        at runtime and optionally save it to per-user config-
                        file for future use; syntax: use 'password:PASSWORD'
                        or 'file:FILENAME' or 'random' (see virt-builder
                        --root-password for more)
  --dnsdomain DOMAIN    Set DNS domain name to be appended to auto-generated
                        HOSTNAME (default: 'example.com'; keep in mind however
                        that this option has no effect if --hostname is
                        specified)
  --hostname HOSTNAME   Set system hostname inside the OS (default:
                        automatically uses VM name; specify '!' to prevent
                        changing the hostname, which implies --no-dhcphostname
                        option)
  --hostname-prompt     Configure upvm to always prompt for system hostname
                        when not specified (default: automatically use VM name
                        + value of DOMAIN with no prompt)
  --no-dhcphostname     Disable the default behavior of adding
                        'DHCP_HOSTNAME=<HOSTNAME>' to ifcfg-eth0
  --img-dir DIR         Set directory where image file will be saved to and
                        launched from (default: '/var/lib/upvm' which is a
                        simple directory-backed libvirt storage pool named
                        'upvm')
  --img-size SIZE       Set output disk image size (default: native template
                        size; example: '7G')
  --img-format {auto,raw,qcow2}
                        Set output disk image format (default: 'auto', to
                        auto-detect based on input image format; however,
                        until this is implemented in virt-builder, it will
                        fallback to qcow2)
  --timezone TIMEZONE   Set system timezone inside the OS (use traditional
                        syntax, i.e., paths rooted in /usr/share/zoneinfo,
                        e.g.: 'Europe/London' or 'America/Los_Angeles' or
                        'Asia/Calcutta')
  --rhsm-key ORGID:KEY  With or without this option, upvm creates a
                        /root/register script inside the guest which can be
                        used to interactively register to RHN Classic or RHSM;
                        this option edits that script to include an RHSM
                        activation key created by you at
                        access.redhat.com/management/activation_keys -- i.e.,
                        so the script can be run without requiring a
                        user/password (to use this option, specify both the
                        organization ID and the activation key, e.g.,
                        '0123456789:my_activation_key'); IMPORTANT NOTE: this
                        does not run the /root/register script for you
  --ssh-pubkey FILE     Inject specific ssh pubkeys (option may be used more
                        than once) into the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file of
                        the guest (default: contents of local
                        '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' and all present pubkeys with
                        standard filenames -- see man page explanation for ssh
                        -i option -- will be automatically injected)
  --upload FILE:DEST    Upload local FILE to DEST in disk image; warning:
                        directories in DEST must exist and file uid/gid &
                        perms are preserved (may be used more than once)
  --run SCRIPT          Launch disk image inside small container, copy local
                        SCRIPT into disk image and execute it chrooted into
                        guest filesystem (may be used more than once)
  --run-command CMD+ARGS
                        Launch disk image inside small container, and execute
                        command chrooted into guest filesystem (may be used
                        more than once)
  --firstboot SCRIPT    Install SCRIPT inside disk image such that it will run
                        on first boot (may be used more than once)
  --firstboot-command CMD+ARGS
                        Configure disk image such that when guest first boots
                        it will execute command (may be used more than once)
  --install PKG,PKG,@GROUP...
                        Launch disk image inside small container and execute
                        'yum/apt-get install' against named package(s),
                        chrooted into guest filesystem (using this auto-
                        triggers SELinux relabel; may be used more than once)
  --firstboot-install PKG,PKG,@GROUP...
                        Configure disk image such that when guest first boots
                        it will install named package(s) (may be used more
                        than once)
  --selinux-relabel     Trigger an SELinux relabel on first boot (critical if
                        any important files are changed)
  --vbuilder-arg, -B ARG
                        Add ARG as an extra option/argument to the virt-
                        builder command which creates the disk image (may be
                        used more than once; NOTE: to pass options that start
                        with a dash, use '--vbuilder-arg=--option' or '-B=-o',
                        for example: '-B=--verbose -B=--update -B=--copy-
                        in=/localpath:/mnt/remote')

TOTALLY OPTIONAL HARDWARE-LEVEL (VM) OPTIONS:
  Guest hardware configured by virt-install (after image is built). Each option
  corresponds with virt-install option of same name. More configurability is
  possible than described. See virt-install man page.

  -m, --memory OPTIONS  If this option is omitted, the guest will be defined
                        with a RAM allocation of 1024 MiB; in its simplest
                        form OPTIONS can be the amount of RAM in MiB; more
                        complicated example: '-m 512,maxmemory=4096' (which
                        would set the default to 512 MiB but allow raising up
                        to 4 GiB without powering off)
  -c, --vcpus OPTIONS   If this option is omitted, the guest will be allocated
                        a single virtual CPU; in its simplest form OPTIONS can
                        be the number of CPUs; more complicated example: '-c
                        1,maxvcpus=4' (which would set the default 1 CPU but
                        allow raising to 4 without powering off)
  -d, --disk OPTIONS    In its simplest form OPTIONS can be 'size=N' to add a
                        new disk of size N GiB to the guest
  -w, --network OPTIONS
                        If this option is omitted, a single NIC will be
                        created in the guest and connected to a bridge (if one
                        exists) or the 'default' virtual network; if this
                        option is used once it will modify the default NIC;
                        this option can be specified multiple times to setup
                        more than one NIC; in its simplest form OPTIONS can be
                        'bridge=BRIDGE' (where BRIDGE is a bridge device name,
                        e.g., 'br0') or 'network=NAME' (where NAME is a
                        virtual network, e.g., 'default'); more complicated
                        example: '-w network=default -w bridge=br0' (where the
                        1st NIC would be connected to the default private
                        network and the 2nd would be connected to the
                        [presumably public] bridge br0)
  --vinstall-arg, -I ARG
                        Add ARG as an extra option/argument to the virt-
                        install command which creates a guest from the vb-
                        created disk image (may be used more than once; NOTE:
                        to pass options that start with a dash, use
                        '--vinstall-arg=--option' or '-I=-o', for example:
                        '-I=--cpu=core2duo -I=--video=cirrus -I=--boot=uefi
                        -I=--graphics=vnc,password=mypass')

ABOUT CONFIG FILES:
  All of the above options can also be set in config files /etc/upvm.conf or
  ~/.config/upvm.conf (e.g., 'loglevel = debug') or specified via environment
  variables capitalized and prefixed with 'UPVM_' (e.g., UPVM_LOGLEVEL=debug).
  See /usr/share/upvm/example.conf for examples of proper config-file syntax
  and keep in mind that cmdline values override environment variables which
  override config file values which override defaults.
